  <p>The 5/3/1 training method is a strength training program developed by Jim Wendler, a renowned strength coach and powerlifter.
  It's designed to gradually increase strength over time while focusing on compound lifts like the squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press.
  Here's how it typically works:</p>
  <p><strong> Four Main Lifts: </strong>
  The program centers around four main lifts - squat, deadlift, bench press, and shoulder press. These lifts form the foundation of the program.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Progression:</strong>
  The program operates on a monthly cycle, with each week having a different focus on weight intensity.
  <ul>
  <li>Week 1: 5 reps at 65%, 75%, and 85% of your one-rep max (1RM)</li>
  <li>Week 2: 3 reps at 70%, 80%, and 90% of 1RM.</li>
  <li>Week 3: 5 reps at 75%, 85%, and 95% of 1RM. The last set on week 3 is typically an AMRAP </li>
  <li>Week 4: Deloading week, where you lift lighter weights to allow for recovery. This is often done at 40-60% of your 1RM</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  We have also incorporated cardio into the routine built around training for a 10k race.
